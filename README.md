### Sequentity Example Application

<br>

### A journey from input to output

...

**Design Decisions**

- Systems and Components share translation unit


### Intentions

Entities are manipulated via `Intent` components.

For example, to move an entity, assign a `Intent::Move` component, carrying its new position. Rotate an entity with the `Intent::Rotate` component.

```cpp
auto move_entity = [](const auto& intent, auto& position) {
    position += intent.delta;
};

registry.view<MoveIntent, Position>().each(move_entity);
```

The Intent System then targets all known intents per iteration of the simulation.

```cpp
void Intent::System() {
    
}
```

### Tools

Intents are generated by so-called "Tools". A tool is an intent-generator, translating some input into intents.

- Tools activate based one or more "intents"
    - `Setup` User has assigned a new tool
    - `Begin` Tool is being activated
    - `Update` Tool is being manipulated, during activation
    - `Preview` Tool is being manipulated, without activation
    - `Finish` Tool is being deactivated
- Tools operate in one of three "modes" called `Primary`, `Secondary`, and `Tertiary`.

Tools get input either from a `Device` or `Event`.

<br>

### Devices

A `Device` represent a physical device, connected to your computer, such as your mouse or keyboard.

**Requirements**

- Distinct handling of press
- Distinct handling of release

Whenever a device triggers a callback, the provided data is translated into device-independent data, suitable for a `Tool`.

### Event

Tools can be recorded and stored into a so-called `Event`. The event holds a copy of the tool at the time of use, along with its history of inputs over the span of time between press and release.

<br>

### Example

Here's how to move an entity `(5, 2)` units on the next call to `update()`.

```cpp
// Move any entity 5 units along X, and 2 units along Y
const auto any_entity = *registry.view<Position>().begin();
registry.assign<MoveIntent>(any_entity, 5, 2);
```
